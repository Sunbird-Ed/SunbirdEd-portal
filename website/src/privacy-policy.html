						<h1>Sunbird Privacy Policy</h1>
						<p>Sunbird is an open source project of EkStep Foundation. This Privacy Policy sets forth the standards that Sunbird ( “Sunbird”) will follow with regard to all activities undertaken and information provided by visitors to www.sunbird.org (the “ Sunbird website”) who subscribe to any of Sunbird’s electronic information services, or otherwise affirmatively communicate with Sunbird (all such visitors are referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Users”).</p>
						<p><strong>Section 1. Information collected</strong></p>
						<p>Sunbird collects information about Users of Sunbird’s website in order to provide electronic information services, and construct a secure and personalised Internet resource.</p>
						<p>The following list includes the different types of information Sunbird collects:</p>

						<p>“Personal Information” is information that would allow someone to identify or contact Users, including, for example, Users’ names, organisations and email addresses. Personal Information does not include aggregated information or information about Users that, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons.

						<p>“Nonpersonally Identifiable Information” is anonymous information about Users that does not include Users’ names or contact information. Examples of such aggregated data would be IP addresses, browser types, and access times. Sunbird may use this information to customise Sunbird’s website for Users and may not include or refer to Personal Information, such as Users’ email addresses, when using this type of data.</p>
						<p><strong>(C) Aggregated Information</strong></p>
						<p>“Aggregated Information” refers to information that Sunbird gathers by aggregating Nonpersonally Identifiable Information to provide summaries of use of the Sunbird’s website. Sunbird uses Aggregated Information to show usage patterns and to do such things as negotiate with vendors of Internet services. Such Information is not linked to Users’ Personal Information.</p>
