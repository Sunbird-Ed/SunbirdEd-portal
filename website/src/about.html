						<h1>Our Story</h1>
						<p><strong>"The world is bigger than your view of the world.  There’s always room for a new idea, a new step..." - Anonymous</strong></p>
						<p>In the year 2016, we at EkStep set ourselves an audacious goal - to ‘Educate 200 million children by the year 2020’.  Building digital infrastructure for learning was the only way to affect change at this scale. In the course of our journey, we built many digital solutions for the learning domain.</p>

						<p>Today, as we near our goal post, we ask - What next? We decided to think beyond.</p>
						<p>Education is a global need not encumbered by age, date or region. Why confine ourselves to an age group or time limit?</p>
						<p>Our free and open source solutions are robust at scale. How can global citizens leverage these solutions?</p>
						<p>Ours was not a solitary journey. Others willingly partnered with us, contributing their expertise in areas that were not our core strength. What will it take to build an ecosystem that connects and nurtures?</p>
						<p>While we focused on our goal, a few early adopters showed us possibilities beyond what we had envisioned. How could they contribute to extend the capabilities of the solution?</p>
						<p>Social change is slow. Setting out on a mission is a daunting task.  Is it possible to make it easy for anyone with a social mission to achieve it?</p>

						<p><strong>Sunbird 2.0 is our attempt to answer these questions. An open-source platform that brings together: </strong></p>
						<ul>
							<li>Knowledge - concepts, thought papers, ideations, research, articles, learning material, etc.</li>
							<li>Processes - a series of steps undertaken to achieve a particular end. For example, how to build strategy maps, structured software thinking, structured program thinking, structured product management thinking, etc.</li>
							<li>Software - software solutions, code components, extensions, tools, etc.</li>
							<li>Hardware - information on the latest available hardware, comparisons between different hardware, choosing the best hardware for a solution, etc.</li>
							<li>Data - data collected during the course of research or usage</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Join us and be a part of a global community of social innovators steeped in the domain of lifelong learning.</p>

						<h1>Explore</h1>
						<p><strong>"Come without a map. Explore it and draw your own map." - Stephen King, Hearts in Atlantis</strong></p>
						<p>Sunbird 2.0 is a searchable, discoverable repository of knowledge resources contributed by educators, engineers, pedagogues, teachers, learning scientists, data scientists and many others who have been part of the journey so far.</p>

						<p>We believe that while technology is a major lever to bring about social change, drivers of change may not be equipped to fully utilize its power.</p>
						<p>Sunbird 2.0 provides access to not just the software solutions built along the way, but also provides insights into the principles, thought processes and techniques used to build them. The intent is to make available resources that anyone can discover, explore, use and repurpose to suit their own program.</p>
						<p>Discovering resources in Sunbird 2.0 is easy because it is backed by a Universal Index. Search the repository using keywords, look through the cards or browse the asset, partner or adopter lists to discover resources that help save time, money and effort.</p>

						<h1>Connect</h1>
						<p><strong>"No bird soars too high if he soars with its own wings" - William Blake</strong></p>
						<p>Just as rising air currents and strong wind speeds allow birds to soar, the right connectors are the wind beneath the wings of any successful mission. Having access to and using the right connectors at the right time energizes the mission.</p>
