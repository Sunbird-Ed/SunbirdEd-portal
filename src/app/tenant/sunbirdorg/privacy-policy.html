						<h1>Sunbird Privacy Policy</h1>
						<p>Sunbird is an open source project of EkStep Foundation. This Privacy Policy sets forth the standards that Sunbird ( “Sunbird”) will follow with regard to all activities undertaken and information provided by visitors to www.sunbird.org (the “ Sunbird website”) who subscribe to any of Sunbird’s electronic information services, or otherwise affirmatively communicate with Sunbird (all such visitors are referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Users”).</p>
						<p><strong>Section 1. Information collected</strong></p>
						<p>Sunbird collects information about Users of Sunbird’s website in order to provide electronic information services, and construct a secure and personalised Internet resource.</p>
						<p>The following list includes the different types of information Sunbird collects:</p>
						<p><strong>(A) Personal Information</strong></p>
						<p>“Personal Information” is information that would allow someone to identify or contact Users, including, for example, Users’ names, organisations and email addresses. Personal Information does not include aggregated information or information about Users that, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons. For example, statistics about how many persons visited the Sunbird’s website last month is not Personal Information.</p>
						<p><strong>(B) Nonpersonally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
						<p>“Nonpersonally Identifiable Information” is anonymous information about Users that does not include Users’ names or contact information. Examples of such aggregated data would be IP addresses, browser types, and access times. Sunbird may use this information to customise Sunbird’s website for Users and may not include or refer to Personal Information, such as Users’ email addresses, when using this type of data.</p>
						<p><strong>(C) Aggregated Information</strong></p>
						<p>“Aggregated Information” refers to information that Sunbird gathers by aggregating Nonpersonally Identifiable Information to provide summaries of use of the Sunbird’s website. Sunbird uses Aggregated Information to show usage patterns and to do such things as negotiate with vendors of Internet services. Such Information is not linked to Users’ Personal Information.</p>

Sunbird  may disclose Nonpersonally Identifiable Information and Aggregated Information about its Users, but that information does not contain Personal Information. If law enforcement or judicial authorities require Sunbird to provide Personal Information concerning any Users, Sunbird must cooperate with the authorities if their requirement is supported with the necessary legal documentation.</p>

Users may choose to discontinue the collection, use, and disclosure of their Personal Information by using Sunbird’s website without registering or by discontinuing their use of Sunbird’s website altogether.</p>
						<p>Please note that if Users provide any information directly to parties other than the Sunbird, including sites linked to by Sunbird’s Website, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the Personal Information Users disclose to them. Sunbird encourages Users to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties.</p>

In addition, if Sunbird makes any material changes in its privacy practices that do not affect Users’ information already stored in its database, Sunbird shall post a prominent notice on the Sunbird’s website notifying Users of the change.
