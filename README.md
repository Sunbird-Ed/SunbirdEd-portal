## What is Sunbird?
[Sunbird](http://sunbird.org) is a next-generation scalable open-source learning solution for teachers and tutors. Built for the 21st century with [state-of-the-art technology](http://www.sunbird.org/architecture/views/physical/), Sunbird runs natively in [cloud/mobile environments](http://www.sunbird.org/features/). The [open-source governance](LICENSE) of Sunbird allows a massive community of nation-builders to co-create and extend the solution in novel ways.

## What is the project mission?
Project Sunbird has a mission to improve learning outcomes for 200 million children across India. This is a multi-dimensional problem unique to the multi-lingual offline population of India (and other developing countries). It's not a problem of any single organization or stakeholder and it cannot be realistically addressed by individual effort. 

Project Sunbird is an [open, iterative and collaborative](http://www.sunbird.org/participate/) approach to bring together the best minds in pursuit of this audacious goal.

## What is the Sunbird portal?
The Sunbird portal is the browser-based interface for the Sunbird application stack. It provides a web-app through which all functionality of Sunbird can be accessed.

## Getting started
