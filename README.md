## What is Sunbird?
[Sunbird](http://sunbird.org) is a next-generation scalable open-source learning solution for teachers and tutors. Built for the 21st century with [state-of-the-art technology](http://www.sunbird.org/architecture/views/physical/), Sunbird runs natively in [cloud/mobile environments](http://www.sunbird.org/features/). The [open-source governance](LICENSE) of Sunbird allows a massive community of nation-builders to co-create and extend the solution in novel ways.

## What is the project mission?
Project Sunbird has a mission to improve learning outcomes for 200 million children across India. This is a multi-dimensional problem unique to the multi-lingual offline population of India (and other developing countries). It's not a problem of any single organization or stakeholder and it cannot be realistically addressed by individual effort. 

Project Sunbird is an [open, iterative and collaborative](http://www.sunbird.org/participate/) approach to bring together the best minds in pursuit of this audacious goal.

## What is the Sunbird portal?
The Sunbird portal is the browser-based interface for the Sunbird application stack. It provides a web-app through which all functionality of Sunbird can be accessed.

## Getting started
To get started with the Sunbird portal, please try out our cloud-based demo site at: https://staging.sunbirded.org/

You can also install the Sunbird portal locally on your laptop, please follow the instructions below:
Have node version 10 and follow the next steps

## Pre Installation Steps

Prerequisities

	1. Node > 14x
	2. Angular 10x
	3. Yarn

Sunbird dev has 2 parts 

		1. Angular client
		2. Node server
    
   ```Go to src/app/helpers/ replace environmentVariablesHelper.js```
    
### Installing and running Angular client

## Step 1: Go to src/app/client folder

    ```console
    git clone https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-portal.git
    ```

    > ***Note***: Stable versions of the sunbird portal are available via tags for each release, and the master branch contains latest stable release. For latest stable release [refer](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-portal/branches)

        1. $ cd {PROJECT-FOLDER}/src/app/client
        2. $ yarn install

    2. Sunbird services stack or the backend API interface

        1. $ cd {PROJECT-FOLDER}/src/app
        2. $ yarn install

3. Configuring the Environment and Services Stack

    > Configure the following system environment variables in the terminal which you have opened

    > The initialization of these environmental variables can take place in a common place like in your **.bashrc** or **.bash_profile**

4. Edit the Application Configuration

    > Open `<PROJECT-FOLDER>/src/app/helpers/environmentVariablesHelper.js` in any available text editor and update the contents of the file so that it contains exactly the following values

      ```console
          module.exports = {
              // 1. LEARNER_URL   
              LEARNER_URL: env.sunbird_learner_player_url || <'https://<host for adopter's instance>',
              
              // 2. CONTENT_URL
              CONTENT_URL: env.sunbird_content_player_url || <'https://<host for adopter's instance>',
              
              // 3. CONTENT_PROXY  
              CONTENT_PROXY_URL: env.sunbird_content_proxy_url || <'https://<host for adopter's instance>',
              PORTAL_REALM: env.sunbird_portal_realm || 'sunbird',
              
              // 4. PORTAL_AUTH_SERVER_URL
              PORTAL_AUTH_SERVER_URL: env.sunbird_portal_auth_server_url || <'https://<host for adopter's instance>',
              PORTAL_AUTH_SERVER_CLIENT: env.sunbird_portal_auth_server_client || "portal",
              ...
              PORTAL_PORT: env.sunbird_port || 3000,
                
              // 5. PORTAL_API_AUTH_TOKEN
              PORTAL_API_AUTH_TOKEN: env.sunbird_api_auth_token || User generated API auth token
              ...
              
              // 6. PORTAL_ECHO_API_URL
              PORTAL_ECHO_API_URL: env.sunbird_echo_api_url || '',
              ...
          }
